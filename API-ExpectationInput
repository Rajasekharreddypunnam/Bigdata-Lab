We will start by building a dataset consisting of the homepages of faculty members from
different universities’ Engineering and Computer Science departments. To achieve this, you
need to identify the faculty directory listing page where all the faculty members of your chosen
department are listed and get the urls for the homepages of all faculty members. You then need
to scrape all the text information, such as the faculty bio and courses they teach, from the
faculty homepage. To prevent overlapping of universities, register the chosen university on the
sign up sheet:
